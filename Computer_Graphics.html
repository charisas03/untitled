						<h3>Image Types</h3>
						<p> In computer graphics, there are many different image types. They are two dimensional 
						images, three dimensional images, and computer animation. The categories under computer
						animation are pixel art, sprite graphics, and vector graphics. In addition to image types 
						there is three dimensional modeling. If you would like to learn about any of these, please
						click the links in the tabs area. </p>

						<h3>2D</h3>
						<p>2D computer graphics are like the computer-based generation of digital images-mostly
						from models, such as digital image and other techniques.</p>
						<p>It is used in applications which used to be printing and drawing technologies(typography)
						It isn't just a representation of a real-world object, it is an artifact. 2D models are more 
						preferred than 3D computer graphics, which is related to more of photography vs. typography. 
						</p>
						
							<h4>Pixel Art</h4>
							<p>Pixel art is a form of digital art. It is created through raster graphics software
							, where images are edited in pixels.</p>
							<p>Graphics in:
							<li>computer games</li>
							<li>video games</li>
							<li>graphing calculator games</li>
							<li>mobile phone games</li>
							are mostly pixel art. </p>
						
							<h4>Sprite Graphics</h4>
							<p>For those of you who don't know what a sprite is, it is a two dimensional image
							or animation that is part of a bigger scene. They were at first handled separately from a video
							display, and it now includes many different option of graphical overlays.</p>
							<p>They were a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps to appear as a normal bitmap on a screen.
							For those of you who don't know what bitmap is, it is a representation in which each item corresponds
							to one or more bits of information, especially the information used to control the display of a computer screen.</p>
							<p>An example of this can be creating an animated character that can be moved across and around the screen
							without altering any of the data that overall defines the screen. Software simulates this through 
							specialized rendering moments. </p>
							
							<h4>Vector Graphics</h4>
							<p>For those of you who don't know what a sprite is, it is a two dimensional image
							or animation that is part of a bigger scene. They were at first handled separately from a video
							display, and it now includes many different option of graphical overlays.</p>

						<h3>3D</h3>
						<p>Three-dimensional graphics are ones that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric
						data. The purpose of this is stored in the computer. It includes images that are for later display or for real-time
						viewing.</p>
						<p>Despite the differences that two-dimensional graphics and three-dimensional graphics have, 
						they rely on similar algorithms in the final rendered version. Because of this in computer graphics, 
						the distinction is hazy since two-dimensional graphical applications use three-dimensional
						techniques to achieve certain effects like lighting. In addition, it also uses primarily
						two-dimensional rendering techniques in three-dimensional graphics.</p>
						<p>Three-dimensional graphics are the same as three-dimensional models. It is contained
						within the graphical data file, distinct from the rendering. There are differences that include
						the 3D model as the representation,although. From printing, they aren't only confined to virtual space.
						3D rendering is how a model can be displayed. It can also be used in non-graphical computer 
						simulations and in addition some calculations.</p>
