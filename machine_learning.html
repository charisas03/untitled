                    <h2>Why Should You Care? <small>(a.k.a. the TL;DR version of it all)</small></h2>

                    <p>Machine learning is exactly what it sounds like-- machines that can learn from their mistakes. And right now, it's being used everywhere in computer science. The fact is, if you want to be a part of modern society, then you'll have to know more about machine learning than just clicking mindlessly on your retweet buttons. Because machine learning is more than the stuff that updates your Facebook feed for you-- it runs almost every piece of technology out there.</p>

                    <h3>What <i>Exactly</i> is Machine Learning Though? <small>(According to Experts)</small></h3>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without
                      being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has
                      given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web
                      search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine
                      learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times
                      a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way
                      to make progress towards human-level AI.</p>

                    <h3>Bored Already?</h3>

                    <p><a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/"target="_blank">Machine learning in action.</a></p>

                    <h3>Knowledge is Power</h3>

                    <p>Whatever you may think, your
                      computer was not pre-programmed to guess the answer. Instead, it goes
                      through your drawing and compares them to other drawings. What you just
                      did with that game, was add to this every-expanding database of
                      doodles that other people have done before you. The only reason that the
                      computer was guess at all, was because every time a drawing is added to
                      its database, it becomes "smarter"-- sort of like how a baby learns
                      how to talk by listening to its parents. What's the coolest part of
                      machine learning? That's right-- there's more: <b>Machine learning
                      barely requires any programming at all.</b> It's hard to imagine right?
                      Anything so complex needs something confusing to make it real. Actually,
                      no. The only vocabulary word to remember when you think of machine learning is
                      <i>algorithm</i>. An <i>algorithm</i> is just a set of rules that
                      a person will program into the computer to make sure that the computer
                      can "learn" properly.</p>

                      <h3>Different Algorithms</h3>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Artificial Neural Networks</li>
                          <li>Deep Learning</li>
                          <li>Inductive Logic Programming</li>
                          <li>Representation Learning</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>These four algorithms are just a few examples of what tools that
                          machine learning uses to "teach" computers how to learn from their mistakes
                          and adjust to how the user well... uses the computer itself. Now, this
                          may sound sort of strange and risky, almost as if humans are attempting
                          to give computers brains (and actually, artificial neural networks try
                          specifically to model computer software after a human brain), but computers
                          most likely, will never be able to achieve the ability of the human brain.
                          For now, machine learning is used for things such as:</p>

                          <ul>
                            <li>Updating Social Media Feeds</li>
                            <li>Text Recognition and Autocorrect</li>
                            <li>Retina Scanners</li>
                            <li>Self-Driving Cars</li>
                          </ul>

                        <h4 class="text-danger"><i>And now you know a little something about it, so go explore ways to create
                          and learn about machine learning, because it's already being used for future
                          technology and you don't want to be left behind.</i></h4>
