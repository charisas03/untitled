    <h1>Why Should You Care? (a.k.a. the TL;DR version of it all)</h1>
      <p>Machine learning is exactly what it sounds like-- machines that can learn
       from their mistakes. And right now, it's being used everywhere in computer
       science. The fact is, if you want
       to be a part of modern society, then you'll have to know more about
       machine learning than just clicking mindlessly on your retweet
       buttons. Because machine learning is more than the stuff that
       updates your Facebook feed for you-- it runs almost every piece of
       technology out there.</p>

    <h3>Knowledge is Power</h3>
      <p>Whatever you may think, your
        computer was not pre-programmed to guess the answer. Instead, it goes
        through your drawing and compares them to other drawings. What you just
        did with that game, was add to this every-expanding database of
        doodles that other people have done before you. The only reason that the
        computer was guess at all, was because every time a drawing is added to
        its database, it becomes "smarter"-- sort of like how a baby learns
        how to talk by listening to its parents. What's the coolest part of
        machine learning? That's right-- there's more: <b>Machine learning
        barely requires any programming at all.</b> It's hard to imagine right?
        Anything so complex needs something confusing to make it real. Actually,
        no. The only vocabulary word to remember when you think of machine learning is
        <i>algorithm</i>. An <i>algorithm</i> is just a set  of rules that
        a person will program into the computer to make sure that the computer
        can "learn" properly.</p>
