<h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
<p>  Artificial intelligence is a field in computer science.
  Its goal is to enable computers to do things normally done by people --
  in particular, things associated with people acting intelligently. </p>

<p>  You and I use Artificial intelligence in everyday life without even
  realizing it. For example, we have virtual personal assistants such as Siri,
  Cortana, or Alexa
to tell us the weather, their favorite animal, and why in the world are fire
trucks red?!
  Maybe people think that Siri has a brain, but really, she's not at all smart.
  Someone smarter has already programmed answers to those questions in Siri
  previously, which only makes her sounds smart.</p>

<h2>The 3 different AI systems</h2>
<p> People have very different goals with regard to building AI systems, and
  they fall into three AI systems: strong AI, weak AI, and the "in-between" AI.

<p> For some, the goal is to build systems that think the same way
  people do. Others just want to ge the job done and don't care if the
  programming has anything to do with human thought. Then there are the ones
  who are in-between,using human reasoning as a model that can inform but not
  something that they aim to imitate. </p>

<p> The work aimed at genuinely simulating human reasoning is called
  "strong AI". Strong AI is used to not only build systems that think but also
  explain how humans think as well. However, we have yet to see a real model of
  strong AI that are actual simulations of human thoughts and logical reasoning,
  as this is a very difficult problem to solve. </p>

<p> The work in the second system, aimed at just getting things to work is
  called "weak AI". Though we might be able to build systems that can behave
  like humans, the results will not tell us anything about how humans think.
  One example of this is IBM's Deep Blue, a system that was an expert chess
  player, but certainly did not play in the same way that humans do. </p>

<p> Finally, the work in the third system is somewhere in the middle of the
  strong and weak AI is a third group called "in-between" AI. They are systems
  that are informed or inspired by human reasoning. This tends to be where most
  of the more powerful work is happening today. These systems are influenced by
  human reasoning, but they are not driven by the goal to perfectly model it.</p>

<h3>Narrow AI vs. General AI</h3>
<p> Some other differences within artificial intelligence are two categories
  which systems fall into: narrow AI and general AI. </p>

<p> The first system, "narrow AI", is designed for specific tasks, while the
  second system, "general AI", is designed for the ability to reason in general.
  People sometimes get confused by this distinction, and consequently, mistakenly
  interpret the specific results in a specific area as somehow scoping across
  all of intelligent behavior. </p>
