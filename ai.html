                  <h2 class="section-heading">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is a field in computer science.
                      Its goal is to enable computers to do things normally done by people --
                      in particular, things associated with people acting intelligently. It's
                      intelligence exhibited by machines.</</p>

                    <p>You and I use artificial intelligence in everyday life without even
                      realizing it. For example, we have virtual personal assistants such as Siri,
                      Cortana, or Alexa
                    to tell us the weather, set alarms, or tell us what our commute is like.
                      Maybe people think that Siri is smart, but really, she's not at all intelligent.
                      Someone with a brain has already programmed answers to those questions in Siri
                      previously, which only makes her sound like she knows everything.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">The 3 Different AI systems</h2>

                    <p>People have very different goals with regard to building AI systems, and
                      they fall into three AI systems: strong AI, weak AI, and the "in-between" AI.</p>

                    <p>For some, the goal is to build systems that think the same way
                      people do. Others just want to ge the job done and don't care if the
                      programming has anything to do with human thought. Then there are the ones
                      who are in-between,using human reasoning as a model that can inform but not
                      something that they aim to imitate.</p>

                    <blockquote>By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it. - Eliezer Yudkowsky</blockquote>

                    <p>The work aimed at genuinely simulating human reasoning is called
                      "strong AI". Strong AI is used to not only build systems that think but also
                      explain how humans think as well. However, we have yet to see a real model of
                      strong AI that are actual simulations of human thoughts and logical reasoning,
                      as this is a very difficult problem to solve.</p>

                    <p>The work in the second system, aimed at just getting things to work is
                      called "weak AI". Though we might be able to build systems that can behave
                      like humans, the results will not tell us anything about how humans think.
                      One example of this is IBM's Deep Blue, a system that was an expert chess
                      player, but certainly did not play in the same way that humans do. </p>

                    <p> Finally, the work in the third system is somewhere in the middle of the
                        strong and weak AI is a third group called "in-between" AI. They are systems
                        that are informed or inspired by human reasoning. This tends to be where most
                        of the more powerful work is happening today. These systems are influenced by
                        human reasoning, but they are not driven by the goal to perfectly model it.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Narrow AI vs. General AI</h2>

                    <p>Some other differences within artificial intelligence are two categories
                      which systems fall into: narrow AI and general AI.</p>

                    <p> The first category, "narrow AI", is designed for specific tasks, while the
                        second category, "general AI", is designed for the ability to reason in general.
                        People sometimes get confused by this distinction, and consequently, mistakenly
                        interpret the specific results in a specific area as somehow scoping across
                        all of intelligent behavior. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Subfields</h2>

                    <p> AI research is divided into subfields that focus on specific problems or
                          approaches or on the use of a paricular tool or towards satisfying particular
                          applications. </p>

                    <p> The central problems of AI research include: reasoning, knowledge, planning,
                            learning, natural language processing, and perception. </p>

                    <p> Approaches include: statistical methods, computational intelligence, and
                              traditional symbolic AI. </p>

                    <p> Many tools are used in AI, including: search and mathematical optimization,
                                logic, methods based on probability and economics. </p>

                    <p> The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics,
                                  philosophy, neuroscience, and artificial psychology. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2

                    <p> In our era, we have entered the world of technology and are in the process of
                      mastering it. Artificial intelligence is extremely beneficial for many daily things, but we
                      need to keep in mind that the things we make using AI are not real. </p>
