<p> Human Computer Interaction, also known as "HCI" is how humans interact with computers. To what extent computers are developed for successful interaction with 
humans. The Association for Computing Machinery defines human-computer interaction as "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation
of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them." Human Computer Interaction researches the design and 
use of computer technology. An important part of this is user satisfaction. Humans interact with computers in many ways and the interface is important for 
this interaction. This is how you can make computers "user-friendly" or easier to use and understand. Since computers are so complex, you need something that
can make computers easier to use for consumers. Because human-computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting 
knowledge from the machine and human side. On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages, and development 
environments are relevant. On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines, linguistics, social sciences, cognitive 
psychology, social psychology, and human factors such as computer user satisfaction are relevant. The goal is to to study the way people use systems and 
infrastructures and design technologies that let you interact with computers in new ways to increase the usabilty of computer interfaces.</p>


	<h1>Human Computer Interface</h1>
	
	
<p>
The human-computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the user and the computer. The flow of information between the human and
computer is called the loop of interaction. The loop of interaction has several features to it, including:

<p>Visual Based: The visual based human computer interaction is probably the most widespread area in HCI.</p>
<p>Audio Based: The audio based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of in HCI systems. This area deals with information
acquired by different audio signals.</p>
<p>Task environment: The conditions and goals set upon the user.<p>
<p>Machine environment: The environment that the computer is connected to, like a laptop in a student's room.</p>
Areas of the interface: Non-overlapping areas involve processes of the human and computer not pertaining to their interaction. Meanwhile, the overlapping
areas only concern themselves with the processes relating to their interaction.
<p>Input flow: The flow of information that begins in the task environment, when the user has some task that requires using their computer.</p>
<p>Output flow: The flow of information that originates in the machine environment.</p>
<p>Feedback: Loops through the interface that evaluate, moderate, and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back. </p>
<p>Fit: This is the match between the computer design, the user and the task to optimize the human resources need.</p>

	<h1>Topics</h1>
	
	
	<h2>Topics in HCI could includeâ€¦</h2>
	
<h3>User customization:</h3>
<p>End-user development studies how normal users could regularly tailor applications to their own needs and use this power to invent new applications based on 
their understanding of their domains. With their deeper knowledge of their own domains, users could be important sources of new applications at the expense 
of generic systems programmers.</p>

<h3> computation:</h3>
<p>Computation is passing beyond computers into every object for which uses can be found. Embedded systems make the environment alive with little computations 
and automated processes, from cooking appliances to lighting and plumbing fixtures to window blinds to automobile braking systems to greeting cards.
To some extent, this development is already taking place. The expected difference in the future is the addition of networked communications that will
permit many of these embedded computations to organize with each other and the user. Human interfaces to these embedded devices will in many cases be very 
different from those appropriate to workstations.</p>

<h3>Augmented reality:</h3>
<p>A common staple of science fiction, augmented reality refers to the notion of layering relevant information into our vision of the world. Existing projects 
show real-time statistics to users performing hard tasks. Future work might include augmenting our social interactions by providing additional information 
about those we converse with.</p>

<h3>Social computing:</h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis. Much of this research draws 
from psychology, social psychology, and sociology. One study found that people imagined a computer with a man's name to cost more than a machine with a 
woman's name. Other research finds that individuals comprehended their interactions with computers more positively than humans, despite behaving 
the same way towards those machines.</p>

<h3>Knowledge-driven human-computer interaction:</h3>
<p>In human and computer interactions, there usually exists a semantic gap between human and computer understandings towards behaviors. Ontology, as a formal
 representation of domain-specific knowledge, can be used to address this problem, through solving the ambiguities between the two groups.</p>
	
	


<h2> Most of the research is in...
	</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Methods for designing novel computer interfaces</li>
	<li>Methods for studying human computer use</li>
	<li>Methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces</li>
	
<p> That is just the surface of Human Computer Interaction. There is so much more to HCI. </p>
