<h1>Computer Security and Cryptology</h1>

	<h2>What are these two fields?</h2>
		<p>These two fields both have a similar objective: to keep sensitive or private information safe.
		These two fields are unique in that instead of creating something like most fields, they protect
		something. These two fields, however, are not the same thing. They are different in that computer 
		security protects the computer itself, while computer cryptography protects the information
		specifically by encrypting it.</p>
	<h2>Computer Security</h2>
		<h3>The Goals of Computer Security</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Keeping private or sensitive information out of the wrong hands</li>
				<li>Keeping private or sensitive information from being changed in</li>
				<li>Keeping people from stopping a computer from doing its job</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Security Threats</h3>
			<p>There is a multitude of different kinds of computersecurity threats out there, and that number
			is increasing as we become more and more reliant on computer systems, there are backdoors, 
			denial-of-service attacks, tamerping, privilege escalation, and clickjacing to name a few.</p>
		<h3>Methods of Computer Security</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>1. Only allowing access to authorized users</dt>
					<dd>An example of this is two-factor authentication which is where access to a system requres
					a password or PIN, or a card, cellphone, etc.
				<dt>2. Blocking any unauthorized activity by using peripherals</dt>
					<dd>These would include mostly hardware protection mechanisms like USB dongles with are used
					to unlock software capabilities, trusted platform modules which integrate cryptographic
					capabilities onty a device, and others.
				<dt>3. Antivirus and firewall software</dt>
					<dd>Firewalls are the most common for network security, and they shield the internal network
					services from unauthorized access and block attacks using packet filtering. Antivirus
					software (or anti-malware software) detects and removes computer viruses and malware.

	<h2>Computer Cryptography</h2>
		<h3>The Goal of Cryptography</h3>
			<p>In computer science, the goal of cryptography is to keep information secret and safe.</p>
		<h3>How Does Computer Cryptography Work?</h3>
			<p>Cryptography is very closely related to compute security, but it protects information in a
			differnt way, by encrypting it. When information is encrypted, it is changed from its originalform
			using a method called a cipher. The new text that iscreated is called a ciphertext. If someone wants
			to find out what the original information said, they have to decrypt it, and to do that said person
			has to know how to change it back, a piece of information that should only be known to authorized 
			personal. While cryptography can be done by people, computers can calculated very quickly and create
			very strong encryptions. The more complicated the encryption, the harder it is to break.
		<h3>The Two General Types of Cryptography</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>1. Symmetric Cryptography</dt>
				<dd>Another name for the information that allows someone to decrypt a message is a key. In 
				symmetric cryptography, the sender of a message and the receiver of a message both know what the
				key is. Most cryptography subtypes are symmetric.</dd>
				<dt>2. Asymmetric Cryptography</dt>
				<dd>This is a harder method. Each person using this method has two keys, a public key that they
				can tell anyone, and a private, secret key that they have for themselves. When sending a message
				they use the public one to encrypt something, it now cannot be decrypted, even by the sender. 
				Only the receiver can decrypt the message with his own private key. The specifics of this type
				of cryptography makes this method less usefull for sending messages than symmetric, so this is
				mostly used for computer signatures. Computer signatures helps a computer know whether a file was
				sent from a certain source.</dd>
	<h2>Conclusion/Takeaway</h2>			
	<p>Computer security and cryptography are how we keep important information safe, secure, and secret. These 
	will be increasingly important fields as the world becomes more and more reliant on computers. This is a
	summary of these rapidly expanding fields, and I hope it encourages you to further investigate!</p>
