					<h2 class="section-heading">What are these two fields?</h2>
                    <p>These two fields both have a similar objective: to keep sensitive or private information safe.
					These two fields are unique in that instead of creating something like most fields, they protect
					something. These two fields, however, are not the same thing. They are different in that computer 
					security protects the computer itself, while computer cryptography protects the information
					specifically by encrypting it.</p>
					
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Computer Security</h2>
					<h3>The Goals of Computer Security</h3>
						<ol>
							<br>
							<li>Keeping private or sensitive information out of the wrong hands</li>
							<br>
							<li>Keeping private or sensitive information from being changed</li>
							<br>
							<li>Keeping people from stopping a computer from doing its job</li>
						</ol>
					<h3>Security Threats</h3>
						<p>There is a multitude of different kinds of computersecurity threats out there, and that number
						is increasing as we become more and more reliant on computer systems. There are backdoors, 
						denial-of-service attacks, tamerping, privilege escalation, and clickjacking to name a few.</p>
					<h3>Methods of Computer Security</h3>
						<br>
						<dl>
							<br>
							<dt>1. Only allowing access to authorized users</dt>
							<br>
								<dd>An example of this is two-factor authentication which is where access to a system requres
								a password or PIN, or a card, cellphone, etc.</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>2. Blocking any unauthorized activity by using peripherals</dt>
							<br>
								<dd>These would include mostly hardware protection mechanisms like USB dongles with are used
								to unlock software capabilities, trusted platform modules which integrate cryptographic
								capabilities onty a device, and others.</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>3. Antivirus and firewall software</dt>
							<br>
								<dd>Firewalls are the most common form of network security; they shield the internal network
								services from unauthorized access and block attacks using packet filtering. Antivirus
								software (or anti-malware software) detects and removes computer viruses and malware.</dd>
						</dl>
					<h2 class="section-heading">Computer Cryptography</h2>
					<h3>The Goal of Cryptography</h3>
						<p>In computer science, the goal of cryptography is to keep information secret and safe.</p>
					<h3>How Does Computer Cryptography Work?</h3>
						<p>Cryptography is very closely related to computer security, but it protects information in a
						differnt way, by encrypting it. When information is encrypted, it is changed from its original form
						using a method called a cipher. The new text that is created is called a ciphertext. If someone wants
						to find out what the original information said, they have to decrypt it, and to do that, said person
						has to know how to change it back, a piece of information that should only be given to authorized 
						personal. While cryptography can be done by people, computers can calculated very quickly and create
						very strong encryptions. The more complicated the encryption, the harder it is to break.</p>
					<h3>The Two General Types of Cryptography</h3>
						<br>
						<dl>
							<dt>1. Symmetric Cryptography</dt>
							<br>
								<dd>Another name for the information that allows someone to decrypt a message is a key. In 
								symmetric cryptography, the sender of a message and the receiver of a message both know what the
								key is. Most cryptography subtypes are symmetric.</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>2. Asymmetric Cryptography</dt>
							<br>
								<dd>This is a harder method. Each person using this method has two keys, a public key that they
								can tell anyone, and a private, secret key that they have for themselves. When sending a message
								they use the public one to encrypt it, but now it cannot be decrypted, even by the sender. 
								Only the receiver can decrypt the message with his own private key. The specifics of this type
								of cryptography makes this method less usefull for sending messages than symmetric, so this is
								mostly used for computer signatures. Computer signatures helps a computer know whether a file was
								sent from a certain source.</dd>
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion/Takeaway</h2>
					<p>Computer security and cryptography are how we keep important information safe, secure, and secret. These 
					will be increasingly important fields as the world becomes more and more reliant on computers. This is a
					summary of these rapidly expanding fields, and I hope it encourages you to further investigate!</p>
