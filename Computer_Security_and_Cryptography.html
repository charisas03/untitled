<h1>Computer Security and Cryptology</h1>

	<h2>What are these two fields?</h2>
		<p>These two fields both have a similar objective: to keep sensitive or private information safe.
		These two fields are unique in that instead of creating something like most fields, they protect
		something. These two fields, however, are not the same thing. They are different in that computer 
		security protects the computer itself, while computer cryptography protects the information
		specifically by encrypting it.</p>
	<h2>Computer Security</h2>
		<h3>The Goals of Computer Security</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Keeping private or sensitive information out of the wrong hands</li>
				<li>Keeping private or sensitive information from being changed in</li>
				<li>Keeping people from stopping a computer from doing its job</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Security Threats</h3>
			<p>There is a multitude of different kinds of computersecurity threats out there, and that number
			is increasing as we become more and more reliant on computer systems, there are backdoors, 
			denial-of-service attacks, tamerping, privilege escalation, and clickjacing to name a few.</p>
		<h3>Methods of Computer Security</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>1. Only allowing access to authorized users</dt>
					<dd>An example of this is two-factor authentication which is where access to a system requres
					a password or PIN, or a card, cellphone, etc.
				<dt>2. Blocking any unauthorized activity by using peripherals</dt>
					<dd>These would include mostly hardware protection mechanisms like USB dongles with are used
					to unlock software capabilities, trusted platform modules which integrate cryptographic
					capabilities onty a device, and others.
				<dt>3. Antivirus and firewall software</dt>
					<dd>Firewalls are the most common for network security, and they shield the internal network
					services from unauthorized access and block attacks using packet filtering. Antivirus
					software (or anti-malware software) detects and removes computer viruses and malware.
